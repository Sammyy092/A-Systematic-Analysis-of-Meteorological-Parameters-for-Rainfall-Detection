### Executive summary
Rainfall depends on various dependent parameters like humidity, wind speed, temperate, weather type etc., and a good forecast result cannot be obtained if it only depends on a single feature. In this research project we present a systematic approach to perform an analysis of different meteorological variables and assess their impact on the occurrence rainfall occurrence. 


### Scripts
+ `Code.ipynb`: is the program code of this methodology. All the code is written in Python programming language.


### Results
+ `corr_matrix.png`: is the correlation matrix of different meteorological parameters with respect to rainfall.
+ `features_scores.png`: is the feature importance score of each parameter in detecting.


### Datasets
+ This sections contains the csv file of the datset `(2510364_USA)` used in our research as a case study.
