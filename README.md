# A-Systematic-Analysis-of-Meteorological-Parameters-for-Rainfall-Detection

Rainfall depends on various dependent parameters like humidity, wind speed, temperate, weather type etc., and a good forecast result cannot be obtained if it only depends on a single feature. In this research project we present a systematic approach to perform an analysis of different meteorological variables and assess their impact on the occurrence rainfall occurrence.
